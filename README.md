## 1.Almost Sorted
[Problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/almost-sorted/problem)

[Solution](https://github.com/ansusabu/HackerRank_solutions/blob/main/Solution/Almost%20Sorted)

**Logic**: Find the first elements which in not in sorted order from front and back. Swap bo the elements and see if the array is sorted or not. If not, reverse the array from the last non sorted element to the first non sorted element and see if the array is sorted or not

## 2.Caesar Cipher
[Problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/caesar-cipher-1/problem)

[Solution](https://github.com/ansusabu/HackerRank_solutions/blob/main/Solution/Caesar%20Cipher)

**Logic**: A normal rotation is done. After z, it should start from a hence use %26

[Solution](https://github.com/ansusabu/HackerRank_solutions/blob/main/Solution/Common%20Child)

**Logic**: This problem is solved using longest common subsequence algorithm

## 4.Connected Cells in a Grid

[Solution](https://github.com/ansusabu/HackerRank_solutions/blob/main/Solution/Connected%20Cells%20in%20a%20Grid)

**Logic**: 


## 10. 3D Surface Area
[Problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/3d-surface-area/problem?isFullScreen=true)

[Solution](https://github.com/ansusabu/HackerRank_solutions/blob/main/Solution/3D%20Surface%20Area)

**Logic**: I have taken 3 conditions for taking the surface area. 
1. No cubes on all the four sides, only stacking up,ie, on z-axis
2. 1 cube on the side of the corner piece, ie, the cubes are either stacked in x-axis and z-axis or y-axis and z-axis.
3. Cubes are stacked in both x-axis, y-axis and z-axis.

For all these cases, the surface area of each cube is calculated based on the corner peice, edge pice center piece etc and sums it up.
